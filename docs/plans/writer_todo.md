### [x] Re-publish `manual-standards.md` to WR

`docs/plans/architecture_decisions.md` was updated (2026-04-23) to add the Connector Pinout Sub-Pages decision. Re-publish by updating `manual-standards.md` in the WR to match. Copy in the new decision section.

### [x] Write `electrical-wire-reference` — Wire Cross-Reference (Section 16)

Source: `docs/references/electrical/wire_bom.csv`. Format the entire wire BOM as a wiki table — do not transcribe by hand; process the CSV systematically.

**Table columns:** Wire Label | From | To | Gauge (AWG) | Color | Length (in) | Notes

**From/To:** Use human-readable descriptions from `component_bom.csv`, not schematic reference designators (e.g., "ARINC 429 Adapter (GAD 29)" not "LRU24"). For fuse holders and buses, use their functional name (e.g., "Main Bus (FH3)").

**Organization:** Sort by wire label — alphabetical by system code letter, then numerically within each code. This groups all A-code wires together, all G-code grounds, etc.

**Add a NOTE near the top:** Pin numbers in this table are schematic symbol pins, not physical connector pins. For physical connector pin assignments, see the relevant component's pinouts page.

**Maintenance note (include as a comment in the source, not published content):** This table is generated from `wire_bom.csv` rev 4 (2026-04-23). When the schematic is revised, regenerate from the updated CSV.

### [~] Write `electrical-wire-marking` — Wire Marking Standard (Section 16)

New TOC page. Source: `docs/references/electrical/ea_wire_marking_standard.md` — publish this into manual page format. The content is complete and authoritative; the task is adaptation to our style and format (status block, headings, citations, NOTE format).

Content covers: label format (system code + circuit ID + segment ID), system codes, wire color conventions, data bus circuit ID ranges (CAN D001–D009, ARINC 429 D010–D099, non-bus D100+), references (MIL-STD-681E, MIL-W-5088L, AC 43.13-1B Ch. 11).

### [x] Write `electrical-wiring` — Wiring (Section 16)

Physical installation standards for wiring on N657CZ. Sources: AC 43.13-1B Chapter 11. Content covers: routing (clearance, chafe protection, separation from heat/fuel), clamping intervals, bundling, shielding, connector installation. Link to `electrical-wire-marking` for labeling/identification standard.

Do NOT duplicate wire marking content here — that belongs on `electrical-wire-marking`.

### [x] Write `electrical-bus-architecture` — Bus Architecture and Schematics (Section 16)

Hub page for the electrical system. Two parts:

**1. Bus architecture description:** Explain the three-bus design (battery bus, main bus, endurance bus) — what is connected to each, why the architecture is structured this way (load shedding, essential equipment on endurance bus). Source: `docs/references/electrical/engineering_report.md` for component assignments; Tom for rationale. Use FH1 (Battery Bus), FH2 (Endurance Bus), FH3 (Main Bus), FH6 (G3X Bus) as the reference fuse holders.

**2. Schematic index:** Links to all four schematic sub-pages with a one-line description of each sheet.

### [x] Publish electrical schematic sub-pages (Section 16)

Four sub-pages, each with a one-sentence description and a full-width embedded SVG. Not in TOC — accessed from `electrical-bus-architecture`.

Copy source SVGs from AR `docs/references/diagrams/electrical/` to WR `assets/schematics/`, renaming per convention:

| Slug | AR source | WR asset |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `electrical-schematic-top` | `N657CZ_elec-Top.svg` | `assets/schematics/sec16-electrical-top.svg` |
| `electrical-schematic-avionics` | `N657CZ_elec-Avionics.svg` | `assets/schematics/sec16-electrical-avionics.svg` |
| `electrical-schematic-alarm-lighting` | `N657CZ_elec-Alrm_Lght_Sys.svg` | `assets/schematics/sec16-electrical-alarm-lighting.svg` |
| `electrical-schematic-mechanical` | `N657CZ_elec-Mech_Sys.svg` | `assets/schematics/sec16-electrical-mechanical.svg` |

Embed syntax:
```html
<img src="/assets/schematics/sec16-electrical-[name].svg" style="width:100%" alt="[Description]">
```

After publishing, add cross-links: `avionics-system-overview` → `electrical-schematic-avionics`; `electrical-lighting` → `electrical-schematic-alarm-lighting`.

### [x] Add citations to avionics pinout sub-pages

Source information provided via `input/writer_todo/pinout_citations.txt`. For each of the 11 pinout pages, resolve the `@@TOM:` flag by:
1. Adding an inline citation to the cited source section
2. Verifying the pinout table data against the cited source

### [~] Write `inspection-annual-condition` — Annual Condition Inspection

Checklist content complete; ready for Reviewer. Open `@@TOM:` flags: spark plug gap spec, propeller bolt torque, GPS antenna model, seat heater install, parking brake actuator config, valve cover torque values.
