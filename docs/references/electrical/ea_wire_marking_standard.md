## Simplified Wire Marking System for Piston GA Aircraft (Revised)

This simplified wire marking system is designed for piston general aviation (GA) aircraft to provide clear, traceable, and standardized identification for maintenance and troubleshooting, with a focus on maximizing information density in a compact format.

### 1. Standard Marking Format

The primary wire marker label uses a compact, three-part structure to identify the wire's **system, specific circuit/function, and physical segment**.

| **Segment** | **Description** | **Length** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Code** | Identifies the major system or zone the wire belongs to. | 1 Character | `A` |
| **Circuit ID** | The unique number or name of the electrical circuit (e.g., matching a schematic line number). | 3-5 Characters | `105` |
| **Segment ID** | A sequential letter for wire segments (A, B, C...) connecting multiple components within the same circuit net. | 1 Character (Optional) | `A` |

**Full Format Example:** `L105A`

* **L:** Lighting System
* **105:** Circuit 105 (e.g., Landing Light Power net)
* **A:** First physical segment of that net run

#### Complete Wire Marking Example

Consider a landing light circuit that runs from the main bus through a circuit breaker, to a switch, and finally to the landing light:

**Circuit Net 105: Landing Light**

| Wire Segment | Label | Description | Endpoints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bus to Circuit Breaker | `L105A` | First segment of lighting circuit 105 | Main Bus → CB-105 |
| Circuit Breaker to Switch | `L105B` | Second segment after circuit protection | CB-105 → SW-105 |
| Switch to Landing Light | `L105C` | Final segment to load | SW-105 → Landing Light |
| Landing Light to Ground | `L105D` | Ground return path | Landing Light → Ground Point |

**Practical Marking (per Aeroelectric Connection 8:1021-1024):**
- Mark each wire segment at both termination points
- Use adhesive number tape (e.g., Digi-Key digit tape) or heat-shrink sleeves with printed markings
- Ensure markings are visible and readable after installation

### 2. System and Circuit Identification Codes

#### Single-Character System Codes

See MIL-W-5088L Appendix B for complete circuit function letters (A-Z). Common examples for piston GA aircraft:

- **A** - Avionics
- **D** - Data (bus and point-to-point data wiring — see Section 4)
- **E** - Engine Instrument
- **F** - Flight Instrument
- **K** - Engine Control
- **L** - Lighting (Illumination)
- **M** - Miscellaneous (Electrical)
- **P** - DC Power (Generation, Distribution, Battery)
- **R** - Radio (Navigational and Communication)
- **U** - Miscellaneous (Electronic) - Common leads, antenna, power circuits
- **V** - AC Power
- **W** - Warning and Emergency

#### Circuit ID and Segment ID

* **Circuit ID (e.g., `105`):** Should directly correspond to a unique net name or line number on the master schematic. This links the physical wire back to the design document.
* **Segment ID (e.g., `A`):** Differentiates physical wires that belong to the same electrical net (Circuit ID). For example, a net that runs from the bus, through a fuse, to a component would use `...A` for the bus-to-fuse segment and `...B` for the fuse-to-component segment.

### 3. Wire Characteristics (Notes)

The wire's physical properties are not included in the main code but must be recorded in the accompanying wiring notes/log.

| Characteristic | Note Location | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wire Gauge** | Wiring Log / Schematic Notes | **20 AWG** (must be noted for proper current rating) |
| **Insulation Type** | Wiring Log / Installation Standard | e.g., **Teflon/Tefzel (MIL-W-22759)** |
| **Primary Wire Color** | System Code Convention (see below) / Schematic | Red (power system), White (lighting), etc. |
| **Endpoints** | Derived from Schematic | **Main Bus** to **ANL Fuse** (for segment A) |

#### Standard Wire Color by System Code

To aid in visual identification and reduce installation errors, wire colors should follow system code conventions where practical:

| System Code | System Type | Standard Wire Color |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L** | Lighting | White |
| **P** | Power (DC) | Red |
| **G** | Ground | Black |
| **R** | Radio/Nav | Gray |
| **A** | Avionics | Blue |

**Notes:**
- These color conventions are recommendations for primary insulation color
- Color coding supplements but does not replace wire marking labels
- Multi-conductor bundles or harnesses may use different colors for individual wires
- Always verify connections against schematic - color coding is a visual aid, not the primary identification method

### 4. Data Bus Wire Identification (System Code D)

Data bus wiring uses system code **D** to distinguish it from avionics power and signal wiring. The circuit ID encodes the bus type and link; the segment letter identifies individual wire runs within a chain topology.

#### Circuit ID Ranges

| Range | Bus Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| D001–D009 | CAN Bus | Reserved for CAN bus wiring |
| D010–D099 | ARINC 429 | Point-to-point ARINC 429 links |
| D100+ | Non-bus | RS-232, RS-422, and discrete data wires |

#### CAN Bus Wiring (D001–D009)

CAN bus uses a daisy-chain topology through each LRU's connector. Two circuit IDs are reserved:

- **D001** — CAN_L (low-side differential wire)
- **D002** — CAN_H (high-side differential wire)

The segment letter identifies each physical hop in the chain:

| Segment | CAN_L Label | CAN_H Label | Wire Run |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| First hop | `D001A` | `D002A` | LRU 1 → LRU 2 |
| Second hop | `D001B` | `D002B` | LRU 2 → LRU 3 |
| Third hop | `D001C` | `D002C` | LRU 3 → LRU 4 |

Both wires of a CAN pair for the same physical hop carry the same segment letter. If more than 26 hops are needed, extend with two-letter suffixes: AA, AB, AC, etc.

#### ARINC 429 Wiring (D010–D099)

ARINC 429 is a unidirectional, point-to-point differential bus. Each link uses two consecutive circuit IDs for its differential pair — even for the A wire (positive), odd for the B wire (negative):

| Link | A Wire Label | B Wire Label |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Link 1 | `D010` | `D011` |
| Link 2 | `D012` | `D013` |
| Link N | `D010 + (N−1)×2` | `D011 + (N−1)×2` |

The range D010–D099 supports up to 45 point-to-point ARINC 429 links. Since ARINC 429 connections are direct point-to-point with no intermediate junctions, a segment letter is not normally required. If a physical connector is installed mid-run, the segment letter applies as normal.

#### Non-Bus Data Wiring (D100+)

Point-to-point data wires not part of a shared bus (RS-232, RS-422, discrete signals) are numbered sequentially starting at D100. Each individual wire receives its own circuit ID. Related wires in a multi-conductor interface (e.g., TX, RX, and GND of an RS-232 link) are assigned consecutive numbers.

#### Cable Type and Color

Data bus wires do not follow the single-wire color convention used for power and avionics wiring. Cable type and color are determined by the applicable bus standard:

- **CAN bus**: Shielded twisted pair per ISO 11898 or equipment manufacturer specification
- **ARINC 429**: Shielded twisted pair per ARINC 429 Part 1 specification
- **RS-232 / RS-422**: Per equipment interface specification

Cable type must be recorded in the wiring log alongside the circuit ID.
